# Portablocks
A bukkit plugin to open workbench, enderchest from your hand.

Open workbench, enderchest and enchantment table from your hand.
No need for commands! Simply shift + left-click and the container will open.
This is especially useful for enderchests as you don't need silk-touch to pick it back up.

Permissions are:
portablocks.use.workbench  
portablocks.use.enchantment_table  
portablocks.use.ender_chest  
portablocks.use.shulker_box  
  
Enabled by default.
